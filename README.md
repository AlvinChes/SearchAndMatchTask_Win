### Search & Match Task (SMT)

This is a [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) adaptation of a tile-matching match-three puzzle game called "Search & Match Task".

The Search & Match Task (SMT) is a computerized visual search task based on the tile-matching match-three video game genre. The task is played on a grid-based puzzle board, filled with different types of colored shapes (tiles). The goal of the task is to find a target pattern of tiles (‘search’) on the puzzle board where two adjacent tiles can be swapped to create a vertical or horizontal line of three identical tiles (‘match’).

The SMT is designed as a single-target visual search task with multiple search target categories. The task permits control over task difficupnglty and collection of performance data. The SMT provides a total of 71 difficulty levels with large numbers of pre-generated trials each. Difficulty levels are defined by set size (width × height) of the puzzle board and the number of different types of colored shapes (tiles). To complete a trial for any given difficulty level, four consecutive puzzle boards with a single target must be matched. On each puzzle board, the goal is to find the target pattern on the puzzle board (‘search’) and swap two adjacent tiles to create a vertical or horizontal line of three identical tiles (‘match’).

<sub>Trial sequence of the Search & Match Task. Each trial of a given level starts with a start board with a given width, height and number of tile types. To complete a trial, four consecutive target patterns (highlighted with white border) must be searched and matched. The top row depicts the lowest level (width = 4, height = 4, types of tiles = 4), the bottom row shows highest level (width = 8, height = 8, types of tiles = 8).</sub>
